# BoxLog

A simple web app to help you remember what’s stored in boxes, shelves, or any container. Create a container, give it a name (e.g., "Christmas Box"), add a cover photo of the container, and upload photos of its contents. Browse your containers in a grid and click one to see its contents.

## Setup
```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```
